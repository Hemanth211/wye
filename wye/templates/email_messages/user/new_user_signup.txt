Hey {{ full_name }},

Glad to have you as a part of the PythonExpress family! If you'd like to register your organization in order host workshops, please do go ahead do so here: (link-to-creating-organization). Otherwise if you have Python skills yourself, why not register yourself as a tutor and visit a few colleges? Sounds intriguing? Register as a tutor here: (link-to-registering-as-a-tutor).
