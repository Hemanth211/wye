Hey {{full_name}},

Thank you for registering your organization on PythonExpress. We are extremely excited to have you onboard! Now that you have your profile ready (link-to-profile), why not go ahead and announce your first workshop (link-to-create-workshop)? As soon as you do that, we'll notify the regional heads and potential teachers about it.

If you have any questions, do visit our FAQ page (link-to-faq-page). If that doesn't answer your question, feel free to drop a line to contact@pythonexpress.org and we'll get back to you.

May the love of Python spread far and wide!
Warmly,
The PythonExpress team
