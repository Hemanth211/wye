        <p>Hey {{full_name}},</p>
		<p>Thank you for registering your organization on PythonExpress.
		 We are extremely excited to have you onboard! 
		 Now that you have your <a href="{{host}}/organisation/{{org_id}}/">profile ready</a>, why not go ahead and <a href="{{host}}/workshop/create/">announce your first workshop?
		 As soon as you do that, we'll notify the regional heads and potential teachers about it.</p>
		<p>If you have any questions, do visit our <a href="{{host}}/faq/">FAQ page</a>. If that doesn't answer your question, feel free to drop a line to contact@pythonexpress.org and we'll get back to you.</p>
		<p>May the love of Python spread far and wide!</p>
		<p>Warmly,</p>
		<p>The PythonExpress team</p>
